# Concrete Canoe Research Writing Assistant

This project uses Python and regex-based data processing to build a custom dataset from Concrete Canoe research papers. The dataset is then used to fine-tune a large language model (LLM) to improve the clarity, structure, and tone of technical writing in engineering reports.

## 🧠 Project Overview

**Goal:**  
Enhance the quality of writing in Concrete Canoe research papers using fine-tuned language models trained on domain-specific data.

### Key Steps:
1. Extract and clean structured text from raw `.jsonl` files  
2. Use regex and Python scripts to format and preprocess the data  
3. Fine-tune a language model on cleaned engineering-focused writing  
4. Evaluate model performance and iterate on dataset quality

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- 🐍 **Python** – Core scripting and data processing  
- 🧹 **Regex** – Used to extract and clean technical writing patterns  
- 📁 **Jupyter Notebooks** – Data cleaning and training workflows
